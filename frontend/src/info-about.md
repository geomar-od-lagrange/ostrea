## OSTREA

**Oyster Spatio-Temporal Dispersal Atlas** — an interactive tool to explore dispersal of European flat oyster (*Ostrea edulis*) larvae and the pathogen *Bonamia ostreae*. Results from biophysical dispersal simulations are visualized for open exploration.

### Why?

European flat oysters were once widespread but are now locally extinct in many areas due to overharvesting, habitat destruction, and disease. Active reef restoration is underway through more than 40 projects coordinated by the [Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA)](https://noraeurope.eu/).

*Bonamia ostreae* is a unicellular parasite that infects oyster immune cells and causes mass mortality. Ocean currents can transport free pathogen cells or infected larvae to sites with no direct human connection to diseased populations — dispersal-driven exposure that biosecurity protocols cannot prevent. Understanding these pathways is essential for site selection, disease zoning, and biosecurity planning.
