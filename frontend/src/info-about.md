## OSTREA

**Oyster Spatio-Temporal Dispersal Atlas** — an interactive tool to explore dispersal of European flat oyster (*Ostrea edulis*) larvae and the pathogen *Bonamia ostreae*. Results from biophysical dispersal simulations are visualized for open exploration.

### Why?

European flat oysters were once widespread but are now locally extinct in many areas due to overharvesting, habitat destruction, and disease. Active reef restoration is underway through more than 40 scientifically-led restoration projects under the umbrella of the [Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA)](https://noraeurope.eu/).

*Bonamia ostreae* is a unicellular parasite that infects oyster immune cells and causes mass mortality. Even when human-mediated transport is controlled, ocean currents can carry free pathogen cells or infected larvae across large distances, a dispersal pathway that biosecurity screening cannot prevent. Understanding these pathways is essential for site selection, disease zoning, and biosecurity planning.

### How to use

- **Click a hex** to select it as a source location for pathogen or infected larval release; click again to deselect
- Connected target hexes are coloured by the **relative concentration** of pathogen reaching each target from that source
- **Multi-select** by clicking additional hexes
- Use **Drifting Depth** and **Time range** to filter dispersal scenarios
- Toggle **Highlights** to show historic populations, aquaculture, restoration, and outbreak sites
- Enable **habitable only** to dim hexes deeper than 85 m
- Click **clear** to deselect all hexes
- Hex colour shows **relative concentration** on a **logarithmic scale** (green = higher; hover for exact value as *a* · 10ⁿ)
