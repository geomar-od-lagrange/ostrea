# Simulate OpenShift restricted SCC UID assignment.
#
# On production OpenShift, the restricted SCC injects a random non-root UID
# (from the namespace's openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range annotation) into every
# pod. This forces containers to run as an unpredictable UID, which breaks
# images that assume a specific user.
#
# MicroShift does NOT have this admission controller, so pods run as whatever
# UID the image specifies. Set restrictedSCC=true to inject a fixed UID
# (1000700000) into all pod securityContexts, simulating the OpenShift
# behavior on MicroShift or kind.
#
# Use this to verify that all images work under arbitrary UIDs before
# deploying to production OpenShift.
#
# Usage:
#   helm template ostrea ./helm/ostrea --set restrictedSCC=true ...
#
# This sets runAsUser/runAsGroup/fsGroup on all pods. The UID 1000700000 is
# chosen to match the conventional test range (openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range
# annotation value used in docs/microshift-deployment-test.md).
restrictedSCC: false
